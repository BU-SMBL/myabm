abstract = {Some segregation results from the practices of organizations, some from specialized communication systems, some from correlation with a variable that is non-random; and some results from the interplay of individual choices. This is an abstract study of the interactive dynamics of discriminatory individual choices. One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to ‘neighborhood tipping.' The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of ‘tipping' begins to emerge. {\textcopyright} 1971, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

@article{Prendergast1997a,
abstract = {If musculoskeletal tissues are indeed efficient for their mechanical function, it is most reasonable to assume that this is achieved because the mechanical environment in the tissue influences cell differentiation and expression. Although mechanical stimuli can influence the transport of bioactive factors, cell deformation and cytoskeletal strain, the question of whether or not they have the potential to regulate tissue differentiation sequences (for example, during fracture healing or embryogenesis) has not been answered. To assess the feasibility of biophysical stimuli as mediators of tissue differentiation, we analysed interfacial tissue formation adjacent to a micromotion device implanted into the condyles of dogs. A biphasic finite element model was used and the mechanical environment in the tissue was characterised in terms of(i) forces opposing implant motion,(ii) relative velocity between constituents, (iii) fluid pressure, (iv) deformation of the tissue and (v) strain in the tissue. It was predicted that, as tissue differentiation progressed, subtle but systematic mechanical changes occur on cells in the interfacial tissue. Specifically, as the forces opposing motion increase, the implant changes from being controlled by the maximum-allowable displacement (motion-control) to being controlled by the maximum-available load (force-control). This causes a decrease in the velocity of the fluid phase relative to the solid phase and a drop in interstitial fluid pressure accompanied by a reduction in peri-prosthetic tissue strains. The variation of biophysical stimuli within the tissue can be plotted as 'mechano-regulatory pathway', which identifies the transition from motion-control to force-control as a branching event in the tissue differentiation sequence.},

@article{Gardner1970,
abstract = {Most of the work of John Horton Conway , a mathematician at Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge , has been in pure mathematics. For instance, in 1967 he discovered a new group--some call it "Conway's constellation"--that includes all but two of the then known sporadic groups. (They are called "sporadic" because they fail to fit any classification scheme.) Is is a breakthrough that has had exciting repercussions in both group theory and number theory. It ties in closely with an earlier discovery by John Conway of an extremely dense packing of unit spheres in a space of 24 dimensions where each sphere touches 196,560 others. As Conway has remarked, "There is a lot of room up there."},

@article{Huiskes1997,
abstract = {Loosening of implants in bone is commonly associated with a development of fibrous interface tissues, due to interface gaps and a lack of mechanical stability. It has been postulated that the differentiation of these tissues to fibrocartilage or bone is governed by mechanical stimuli. The objective of our research is to unravel these relationships to the extent that the question whether an implant will loosen can be answered from initial conditions determined by implant and interface morphology, and functional loads. In this project we studied the hypothesis that distortional strain and interstitial fluid flow are the mechanical stimuli governing tissue differentiation. For that purpose, a biomechanical regulatory model was developed and used in association with a finite element code to simulate animal experiments with implants moving in bone. The similarities between the implant incorporation process found in the experiment and its simulation with the computer model demonstrate that our hypothesis is viable from a regulatory point of view.},

@article{Pieuchot2018a,
abstract = {Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to apprehend and adapt finely to their environment. Here we report a new cellular ability, which we term “curvotaxis” that enables the cells to respond to cell-scale curvature variations, a ubiquitous trait of cellular biotopes. We develop ultra-smooth sinusoidal surfaces presenting modulations of curvature in all directions, and monitor cell behavior on these topographic landscapes. We show that adherent cells avoid convex regions during their migration and position themselves in concave valleys. Live imaging combined with functional analysis shows that curvotaxis relies on a dynamic interplay between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton—the nucleus acting as a mechanical sensor that leads the migrating cell toward concave curvatures. Further analyses show that substratum curvature affects focal adhesions organization and dynamics, nuclear shape, and gene expression. Altogether, this work identifies curvotaxis as a new cellular guiding mechanism and promotes cell-scale curvature as an essential physical cue.},

@article{Bidan2013,
abstract = {Scaffolds for tissue engineering are usually designed to support cell viability with large adhesion surfaces and high permeability to nutrients and oxygen. Recent experiments support the idea that, in addition to surface roughness, elasticity and chemistry, the macroscopic geometry of the substrate also contributes to control the kinetics of tissue deposition. In this study, a previously proposed model for the behavior of osteoblasts on curved surfaces is used to predict the growth of bone matrix tissue in pores of different shapes. These predictions are compared to in vitro experiments with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells cultivated in two-millimeter thick hydroxyapatite plates containing prismatic pores with square- or cross-shaped sections. The amount and shape of the tissue formed in the pores measured by phase contrast microscopy confirms the predictions of the model. In cross-shaped pores, the initial overall tissue deposition is twice as fast as in square-shaped pores. These results suggest that the optimization of pore shapes may improve the speed of ingrowth of bone tissue into porous scaffolds. Bone tissue growth depends on the local curvature of the substrate. A simple mathematical model predicts the observations of in vitro tissue growth inside convex and non-convex pores. Experiments show that tissue growth rates can be doubled by changing the geometry of a prismatic pore from square to cross-like. Methods based on these observations are proposed to optimize the design of porous scaffolds. {\textcopyright} 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},
